    <p>A <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.<br> Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

        One key difference between a typical database and a <mark>blockchain</mark> is how the data is collected.  <img align="right"

All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.

    <p id="dark">Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer
        Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer
        incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates
        to be collected into one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been
        published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[14]
    
        The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in
        2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without
        requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which
        blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of
        the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]
    
        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the
        network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[15] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016
        to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in web.<br> The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by
        early 2020.[16]
    
        The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized
        as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[17]
    
        <br> According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains
        attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[18]
        Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital
        Commerce.
    
        In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
        organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
        blockchain".[19] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer'
        for their business.[20]

    <h2><b>Structure & Designs</b></h2>
        <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<br><sub>[3][21]</sub> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[22] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[23] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[24] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]

            Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sub>[25]</sub></p>
